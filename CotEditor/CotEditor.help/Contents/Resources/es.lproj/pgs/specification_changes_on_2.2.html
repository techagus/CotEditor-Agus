<h1>Important changes on CotEditor 2.2</h1>

<p>CotEditor has been Sandboxed since version 2.2.0. It includes some specification changes from the previous versions in order to conform to the Sandbox and the Mac App Store rules. If you’ve used the legacy version before, you may need some manual migrations.</p>


<h2>User Settings Location</h2>
<p>The location of the general CotEditor settings moved from <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/</code> to <code>~/Library/Containers/com.coteditor.CotEditor/Data/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/</code>. This migration will be automatically done on the first launch of CotEditor 2.2.0.</p>


<h2>Scripts Folder Location</h2>
<p>The location of the scripts folder moved from <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/ScriptMenu/</code> to <code>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.coteditor.CotEditor/</code>. <strong>Users need to migrate their script to the new folder manually</strong>, since CotEditor doesn’t have the write permission to the new location.</p>


<h2><code>cot</code> Command-Line Tool</h2>
<p>From CotEditor 2.2.0, the <code>cot</code> command-line tool is no more bundled to CotEditor.app but provided separately on our web site. Download the new one from <del>http://coteditor.com/cot</del> and isntall it manually. The old one is not compatible with CotEditor 2.2.0.</p>
<p class="addition"><span>(update)</span> Since CotEditor 2.3.0, the cot command has been bundled into the CotEditor.app again. Refer <a href="about_cot.html">Work with cot command</a> for the latest installation guidance.</p>
