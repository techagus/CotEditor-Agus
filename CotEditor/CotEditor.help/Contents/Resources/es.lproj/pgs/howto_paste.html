<h1>Paste text in CotEditor</h1>

<p>You can paste the plain-text information in the clipboard to the insertion points in the current editor by choosing Edit &gt; Paste or pressing <kbd>Command</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd>.</p>
<p>When the text is pasted, CotEditor implicitly converts the line endings in the text to paste to the line endings in the document to be pasted so that you donâ€™t need to care about the difference in the line endings types.</p>


<h2>Paste exactly</h2>

<p>In contrast to the normal Paste, the Paste Exactly command inserts the text data in the Clipboard to the insertion point without any implicit normalization. To perform the Paste Exactly command, choose Edit &gt; Paste Exactly which is visible only while pressing the Option key, or press the <kbd>Command</kbd>-<kbd>Option</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd> key.</p>
<p>Be aware that the Paste Exactly command can make the line endings in the document inconsistent.</p>
