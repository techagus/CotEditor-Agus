<h1>Change Snippets settings in CotEditor</h1>

<p>In the CotEditor app <img class="appicon" src="../../Shared/gfx/icon_16x16@2x.png" height="16" alt=""/> on your Mac, use Snippets settings to define preset texts to insert with a command or by dropping a file onto the editor. To change these settings, choose CotEditor &gt; Settings, then click Snippets.</p>
